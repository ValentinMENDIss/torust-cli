# Getting Started

### Running the code

To run the code you need to be in the 'torust-cli' directory. To do this use 'cd' function in the terminal to locate the file.
Now write following to build/compile the program:

```sh
cargo build
```

And write following to run the program:

```sh
cargo run
```

Now the program should have started. Have fun with it :)

## Something does not work / I have a Problem (HELP)  ðŸ›Ÿ
If you have a problem, for example something does not work correctly, try to compile the main.rs file with cargo, like following:
*cargo build*.
Also try to "cd" (change directory/folder) to *"torust-cli"* directory/folder and run the program from there.


After this everything should be working fine. If not please submit the problem on the Github page, so I could help you :).
