# torust-cli

**ToRust-CLI** is To-Do list (CLI-Tool) written in Rust

## Important Information

**The program was created for purpose of learning Rust programming language :)** 

### So, what it does? 
"torust-cli" - is a CLI application that can help you with creating todo-lists.
By running the program you can add new todo-lists and save them in the .txt file.

### Why have I created it?  ðŸ’­
This program was created for purpose of learning Rust programming language. As to make todo-list CLI application you need to know/learn basics of a programming language that your code will be written in.
During this I can create an application that I or anybody else can use and expand in the features, while also learning the fundamentals of the new programming language (for me). 

### Status of the tool

To get you know about the project, we will write the current status of the tool right here. Yeah right here :)

**IN DEVELOPMENT (BETA-RELEASE)**


# Getting Started

### Basic Installation Guide

### Make sure you have Rust installed
To install this shell script you will need to install rust if you don't have it already on your system.
After it everything is ready to work on any UNIX-like Operating System and even on Windows :).

To check if rust is installed on your system run following in the terminal:

```sh
rustc --version
```

if you no version of rustc is printed out, see original documentation on rust's website on how to install it.

### Running the code

To run the code you need to be in the 'torust-cli' directory. To do this use 'cd' function in the terminal to locate the file.
Now write following to build/compile the program:

```sh
cargo build
```

And write following to run the program:

```sh
cargo run
```

Now the program should have started. Have fun with it :)

## Something does not work / I have a Problem (HELP)  ðŸ›Ÿ
If you have a problem, for example something does not work correctly, try to compile the main.rs file with cargo, like following:
*cargo build*.
Also try to "cd" (change directory/folder) to *"torust-cli"* directory/folder and run the program from there.


After this everything should be working fine. If not please submit the problem on the Github page, so I could help you :).
